# Working notes

- Maintain consistency in how reflections are written.

- Capture ideas quickly before they fade.

- Keep reflections short and meaningful.

- Revisit earlier observations for deeper interpretation.

- Reflect on small changes to understand long-term direction.

- Review past notes to see patterns that repeat.

- Avoid rushing conclusions before seeing the full picture.
